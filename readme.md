# Project # 2 Task Tavern

## Description

We created an app that allows users to post requests or take on other users request to capitalize on the booming gig economy. As a User you can create an account and start posting requests which we will call Quests. A quest can be any form of task from menial labor to skilled professional. The user can set the price or reward for the Quest and other users can choose to accept the quest. Quest Takers can take on any number of quests which are then placed on their account. Upon completion a user will earn points that will accrue where they can earn badges to show off their expertise.

## Tasks

- Created Models for the User, Quest, and Badges
- Created api and home routes for each Model type.
- Built associations between the various models and used the data to populate handlebars views.
- Created views that display user, quest, and badge data. The various pages interact with eachother and are responsive.
- Created a navbar that allows the user to easily navigate the page for a better UX/UI experience.
